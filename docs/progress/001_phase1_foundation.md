# 001 - Phase 1: Foundation

## Overview
Phase 1 implements the foundational multi-dimensional encoding system for the cognitive memory architecture. This phase focuses on building the core encoding capabilities that will enable rich memory representation through rule-based dimension extraction and fusion with semantic embeddings.

#### Next Steps
- Begin Phase 2: Storage implementation
- Implement Qdrant collections for hierarchical memory storage
- Create basic memory persistence layer

## Technical Notes

### Multi-Dimensional Encoding Architecture
The encoding system implements a hybrid approach combining:
- **Semantic Embeddings**: Sentence-BERT (all-MiniLM-L6-v2) providing 384-dimensional semantic vectors
- **Cognitive Dimensions**: 4 rule-based extractors providing 16 additional dimensions
  - Emotional (4D): frustration, satisfaction, curiosity, stress
  - Temporal (3D): urgency, deadline pressure, time context
  - Contextual (6D): work context, problem type, environment factors
  - Social (3D): collaboration, support, interaction patterns
- **Fusion Layer**: Learned linear transformation to 512-dimensional cognitive vectors

### Implementation Structure
```
cognitive_memory/encoding/
├── __init__.py
├── dimensions.py         # Rule-based dimension extractors
├── sentence_bert.py      # Sentence-BERT wrapper
└── cognitive_encoder.py  # Multi-dimensional fusion
```

### Design Decisions
- **Rule-based approach**: Provides interpretability and control over dimension extraction
- **Linear fusion**: Simple but effective combination of semantic and dimensional features
- **512D output**: Balances expressiveness with computational efficiency
- **Modular design**: Each extractor can be developed and tested independently

## Dependencies
- sentence-transformers (Sentence-BERT)
- torch (PyTorch for neural components)
- transformers (for sentiment analysis models)
- regex patterns for temporal/contextual extraction
- Pre-trained sentiment analysis models

## Risks & Mitigation
- **Risk**: Rule-based extractors may be too simplistic for complex cognitive dimensions
  - **Mitigation**: Start with simple patterns, iterate based on testing and feedback
- **Risk**: Dimension fusion may not capture meaningful interactions
  - **Mitigation**: Implement linear fusion first, plan for more sophisticated fusion in Phase 2
- **Risk**: 512D vectors may be too large for initial implementation
  - **Mitigation**: Monitor performance, reduce dimensionality if needed
