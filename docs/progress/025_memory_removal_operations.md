## Technical Notes

### Existing Infrastructure to Leverage
- **Vector Deletion**: `delete_vector(id: str)` in `qdrant_storage.py` (line 538-568)
- **Source Path Deletion**: `delete_memories_by_source_path()` in `cognitive_system.py` (line 827-928)
- **Collection Management**: Project-scoped collection deletion methods
- **Operations Pattern**: Existing `CognitiveOperations` class structure
- **CLI Pattern**: Existing `remove_file_cmd` in `cognitive_commands.py`
- **MCP Pattern**: Existing tool registration and response formatting

### Key Design Decisions
- **Transaction Safety**: All deletions wrapped in database transactions
- **Dual Cleanup**: Both vector (Qdrant) and metadata (SQLite) deletion required
- **Safety Features**: Confirmation prompts for CLI, direct operation for MCP
- **Batch Processing**: Tag-based deletions processed in batches for performance
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error reporting with partial success handling

### Memory Identification Strategy
- **ID-based**: Direct lookup using UUID memory identifiers
- **Tag-based**: Metadata query filtering on memory tags array
- **Validation**: Ensure memory exists before attempting deletion
- **Cross-collection**: Search across all hierarchy levels (L0, L1, L2)

## Dependencies

### Internal Module Dependencies
- `cognitive_memory/storage/qdrant_storage.py` - Vector deletion implementation
- `cognitive_memory/storage/sqlite_persistence.py` - Metadata deletion implementation
- `cognitive_memory/core/cognitive_system.py` - Core deletion coordination
- `heimdall/operations.py` - Operations layer extension
- `heimdall/cli_commands/cognitive_commands.py` - CLI command implementation
- `heimdall/mcp_server.py` - MCP tool implementation

### External Dependencies
- Qdrant client for vector deletion operations
- SQLite for metadata and connection cleanup
- Rich library for CLI formatting and confirmation prompts
- MCP protocol for tool registration and response formatting

### Blocking/Blocked Dependencies
- **Blocking**: None identified
- **Blocked by**: None identified
- **Enables**: Enhanced memory lifecycle management, task-based memory cleanup workflows

## Risks & Mitigation

### Identified Risks
1. **Data Loss**: Accidental deletion of important memories
   - **Mitigation**: Dry-run mode, confirmation prompts, detailed preview of deletions

2. **Partial Deletion**: Vector deleted but metadata remains (or vice versa)
   - **Mitigation**: Transaction wrapping, rollback on failure, comprehensive error reporting

3. **Performance Impact**: Large tag-based deletions affecting system responsiveness
   - **Mitigation**: Batch processing, configurable batch sizes, progress reporting

4. **Orphaned Data**: Connections remaining after memory deletion
   - **Mitigation**: Cascade deletion handling, connection graph cleanup

### Performance Considerations
- **Batch Operations**: Process tag-based deletions in configurable batches
- **Index Updates**: Deferred index updates for bulk operations
- **Memory Efficiency**: Stream processing for large deletion sets
- **Connection Cleanup**: Efficient cascade deletion for memory connections
