### Key Algorithms

#### Activation Spreading (BFS)
- Start with high-similarity memories at L0 (concepts)
- Spread activation through connection graph using breadth-first search
- Apply activation threshold to limit computational overhead
- Track activation strength for result ranking

#### Similarity Search
- Compute cosine similarity between query and memory vectors
- Search across all hierarchy levels (L0, L1, L2)
- Apply recency bias to prefer recent memories
- Return ranked results with similarity scores

#### Bridge Discovery
- Identify memories with low direct similarity to query
- Compute connection potential through activated memories
- Calculate bridge score: `(novelty * 0.6) + (connection_potential * 0.4)`
- Return top-k bridge memories for serendipitous connections

### Key Design Decisions
- **Simple algorithms**: Focus on correctness over sophistication for Phase 1
- **Threshold-based activation**: Computationally efficient activation spreading
- **Hierarchical search**: Leverage L0→L1→L2 structure for efficient retrieval
- **Interface compliance**: All retrievers implement abstract interfaces
- **Modular design**: Each retrieval method can be tested independently

## Dependencies
- torch (tensor operations for similarity computation)
- collections.deque (BFS queue implementation)
- numpy (numerical operations for scoring)
- typing (type hints for interfaces)
- Core storage and memory components from previous steps

## Integration Points
- **With Storage**: Retrieval accesses memories through storage interfaces
- **With Encoding**: Uses cognitive vectors from encoding system
- **With Core**: Implements retrieval interfaces defined in `core/interfaces.py`
- **Future Phases**: Foundation for advanced activation and bridge discovery

## Algorithm Specifications

### Basic Activation Spreading
```python
def activate_memories(context_vector, threshold=0.7, max_activations=50):
    # Phase 1: Find high-similarity L0 concepts
    l0_matches = storage.search_level(0, context_vector, threshold)

    # Phase 2: BFS through connection graph
    activated = set()
    queue = deque(l0_matches)

    while queue and len(activated) < max_activations:
        current = queue.popleft()
        if current.id not in activated:
            activated.add(current.id)
            connected = connection_graph.get_connections(current.id, threshold)
            queue.extend(connected)

    return ActivationResult(activated, strengths)
```

### Simple Bridge Discovery
```python
def discover_bridges(query_context, activated_memories, k=5):
    candidates = get_non_activated_memories(activated_memories)
    bridge_scores = []

    for candidate in candidates:
        # Novelty = inverse similarity to query
        novelty = 1.0 - cosine_similarity(query_context, candidate.vector)

        # Connection potential to activated memories
        connection_potential = max(
            cosine_similarity(candidate.vector, activated.vector)
            for activated in activated_memories
        )

        bridge_score = (novelty * 0.6) + (connection_potential * 0.4)
        bridge_scores.append((candidate, bridge_score))

    return sorted(bridge_scores, key=lambda x: x[1], reverse=True)[:k]
```
