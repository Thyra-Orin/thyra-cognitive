# 000 - Project Bootstrapping

## Overview
Initial project setup and foundation establishment for the cognitive memory system. This milestone encompasses the creation of the basic project structure, configuration files, development environment setup, and the foundational components required to begin Phase 1 implementation.

## Status
- **Started**: 2025-06-16
- **Current Phase**: Complete and Verified
- **Completion**: 100%
- **Completed**: 2025-06-17 (Final verification and cleanup completed)

## Objectives
- [x] Create complete directory structure following technical specification
- [x] Set up Python 3.13 virtual environment and dependencies
- [x] Configure development tools (ruff, mypy, black, pytest)
- [x] Set up pre-commit hooks and quality gates
- [x] Create base configuration management system
- [x] Implement core interfaces and abstract base classes
- [x] Set up SQLite database schema
- [x] Configure Qdrant vector database connection
- [x] Create basic project documentation
- [x] Establish testing framework

### Technology Stack
- **Python**: 3.13 (latest features, async support, type hints)
- **Vector Database**: Qdrant (production-ready, hierarchical collections)
- **ML Framework**: PyTorch (research flexibility, transformers ecosystem)
- **Base Embeddings**: Sentence-BERT (all-MiniLM-L6-v2)
- **Persistence**: SQLite + JSON (zero-setup, ACID transactions)
- **Configuration**: .env files with python-dotenv
- **Logging**: Loguru (structured logging)

## Dependencies
- Python 3.13 environment
- Qdrant server (local deployment)
- No external blocking dependencies for initial setup

## Risks & Mitigation
- **Risk**: Complex architecture might be over-engineered for initial implementation
  - **Mitigation**: Focus on interface-driven design to allow incremental complexity
- **Risk**: Python 3.13 compatibility issues with some libraries
  - **Mitigation**: Fallback to Python 3.12 if needed, test dependencies early

## Resources
- Architecture specification: `architecture-technical-specification.md`
- Progress tracking format: `docs/progress/README.md`
- Python 3.13 documentation: https://docs.python.org/3.13/
- Qdrant documentation: https://qdrant.tech/documentation/
