## Technical Notes

### GitHistoryMiner Architecture
```python
class GitHistoryMiner:
    """Secure git data extraction with validation and filtering."""

    def __init__(self, security_validator: SecurityValidator):
        self.security = security_validator

    def extract_commit_history(self, repo_path: str, time_window: str) -> List[CommitEvent]:
        """Extract validated commit data with time filtering."""

    def extract_problem_commits(self, commits: List[CommitEvent]) -> List[ProblemCommit]:
        """Identify problem indicators in commit messages."""

    def extract_file_changes(self, commits: List[CommitEvent]) -> List[FileChangeEvent]:
        """Parse git diff data with path consistency tracking."""
```

### Pattern Detection Algorithms

#### Co-change Pattern Detection
- **Co-occurrence Matrix**: Build file change correlation matrix
- **Statistical Significance**: Chi-square test for co-change relationships
- **Support Calculation**: `support = co_change_count / total_change_opportunities`
- **Confidence Formula**: `support / (support + 2) * recency_weight`

#### Maintenance Hotspot Detection
- **Problem Frequency**: Count bug/fix commits per file over time
- **Trend Analysis**: Calculate hotspot score change over time windows
- **Hotspot Score**: `problem_frequency / total_commits * consistency_factor`
- **Quality Rating**: Based on problem type consistency and severity

#### Solution Pattern Mining
- **Fix Correlation**: Associate problem types with successful solutions
- **Success Rate**: `successful_fixes / total_attempts`
- **Applicability Confidence**: Pattern generalization reliability
- **Effectiveness Ranking**: Solution quality based on success history

### Data Structures with Validation

#### CommitEvent
```python
@dataclass
class CommitEvent:
    commit_hash: str  # SHA-1/SHA-256 validation
    files_changed: List[str]  # Path sanitization
    message: str  # Unicode normalization, length limits
    timestamp: datetime  # ISO format validation
    author: str  # Format validation

    def validate(self) -> bool:
        """Comprehensive validation of commit data."""
```

#### FileChangeEvent
```python
@dataclass
class FileChangeEvent:
    file_path: str  # Canonical path normalization
    change_type: str  # ADD, MODIFY, DELETE, RENAME
    commit_hash: str  # Foreign key validation
    lines_added: int  # Non-negative validation
    lines_removed: int  # Non-negative validation
```

    file_a: str
    file_b: str
    support_count: int
    confidence_score: float
    recency_weight: float
    quality_rating: str

@dataclass
class MaintenanceHotspot:
    file_path: str
    problem_frequency: int
    hotspot_score: float
    trend_direction: str
    recent_problems: List[str]

@dataclass

    problem_type: str
    solution_approach: str
    success_rate: float
