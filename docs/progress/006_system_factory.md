# 006 - System Factory and Initialization

## Overview
Phase 1 Step 006 implements a centralized system factory pattern to address the critical gap in system initialization and dependency wiring. This step creates the "glue" that makes the cognitive memory system runnable by providing clean entry points for users and interfaces while maintaining the existing interface-driven architecture.

    """Create system with default implementations and sensible defaults"""

def create_system_from_config(config_path: str) -> CognitiveMemorySystem:
    """Create system from configuration file with custom implementations"""

def create_test_system(**overrides) -> CognitiveMemorySystem:
    """Create system with test stubs and component overrides for testing"""
```

```

## Technical Design

### Factory Pattern Architecture
```
System Factory Layer
├── Factory Functions
│   ├── create_default_system()     # Default implementations
│   ├── create_test_system()        # Test overrides
│   └── create_system_from_config() # Configuration-driven
├── Component Creation
│   ├── Embedding Provider creation
│   ├── Vector Storage initialization
│   ├── Memory Storage setup
│   ├── Connection Graph creation
│   ├── Activation Engine setup
│   └── Bridge Discovery initialization
└── Validation Layer
    ├── Interface compliance checking
    ├── Configuration validation
    └── Health check coordination
```

### Dependency Wiring Strategy
1. **Default Component Selection**: Sensible defaults for each interface
2. **Configuration Override**: Config file can specify alternative implementations
3. **Test Override**: Direct component injection for testing
4. **Fail-Fast Validation**: ABC compliance and health checks at creation
5. **Clean Error Reporting**: Specific error messages for initialization failures

### Interface Compliance
- All factory-created components must implement required abstract interfaces
- Factory validates `isinstance(component, RequiredInterface)` before wiring
- Initialization failures provide clear error messages about missing implementations
- Components are validated individually before system assembly

## Integration Points

### CLI Integration
- CLI main() calls factory to get system instance
- No initialization logic remains in CLI
- Clean error handling for factory failures
- CLI focuses purely on user interaction

### Future Interface Integration
- HTTP API will use same factory pattern
- MCP server will use same factory pattern
- All interfaces remain decoupled from initialization
- Factory provides single source of truth for system creation

### Testing Integration
- Unit tests can inject mock components via factory
- Integration tests use factory with real components
- Test isolation maintained through factory-created instances
- Easy component substitution for testing edge cases

## Risk Assessment and Mitigation

### Technical Risks
- **Risk**: Factory becomes complex "god object"
  - **Mitigation**: Keep factory functions focused and simple, delegate to helpers
- **Risk**: Configuration complexity grows unmanageable
  - **Mitigation**: Start with simple defaults, add complexity incrementally
- **Risk**: Initialization failures are hard to debug
  - **Mitigation**: Detailed error messages and validation at each step

### Integration Risks
- **Risk**: Breaking existing test infrastructure
  - **Mitigation**: Gradual migration, maintain compatibility during transition
- **Risk**: CLI becomes unreliable due to initialization complexity
  - **Mitigation**: Robust error handling and fallback mechanisms
- **Risk**: Factory patterns unfamiliar to contributors
  - **Mitigation**: Clear documentation and simple, obvious patterns
