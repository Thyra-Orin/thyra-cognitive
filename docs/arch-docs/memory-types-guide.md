# Memory Types in Cognitive Memory System

## Overview

The Cognitive Memory System categorizes retrieved memories into three distinct types that mirror how human memory and cognition work. This tri-fold classification enables both focused recall and serendipitous discovery, creating a truly cognitive approach to information retrieval.

## The Three Memory Types

### üéØ Core Memories

**Definition**: The most directly relevant memories to your query, representing the central concepts and experiences most closely related to what you're asking about.

**Characteristics**:
- **Activation Threshold**: ‚â• 0.7 (highest relevance score)
- **Purpose**: Direct, focused responses to your query
- **Visual Style**: Blue border in interactive shell
- **Cognitive Role**: Primary working memory content

**How They're Determined**:
Core memories are selected based on the highest activation strength, calculated from:
- Direct semantic similarity to your query
- Frequency of access (memories you retrieve often get boosted)
- Importance scores (manually assigned or inferred)
- Temporal relevance (recent memories get slight preference)

**Examples**:
- **Query**: "machine learning algorithms"
- **Core Memories**:
  - Your notes on neural networks
  - A document about gradient descent
  - Your experience implementing a classifier

### üåê Peripheral Memories

**Definition**: Moderately relevant memories that provide broader context, related concepts, and supporting associations that enrich understanding.

**Characteristics**:
- **Activation Threshold**: ‚â• 0.5 but < 0.7 (moderate relevance score)
- **Purpose**: Contextual support and related associations
- **Visual Style**: Dim border in interactive shell
- **Cognitive Role**: Extended context and background knowledge

**How They're Determined**:
Peripheral memories have moderate activation strength and often include:
- Related but not directly matching concepts
- Background knowledge that supports understanding
- Memories connected through associative links
- Contextual information from similar domains

**Examples**:
- **Query**: "machine learning algorithms"
- **Peripheral Memories**:
  - General programming best practices
  - Statistics and probability concepts
  - Data preprocessing techniques
  - Your experience with Python libraries

### üåâ Bridge Memories

**Definition**: Memories that create unexpected connections between distant concepts through low direct similarity but high connection potential, enabling serendipitous discoveries.

**Characteristics**:
- **Special Algorithm**: Distance inversion + connection potential
- **Purpose**: Creative insights and novel associations
- **Visual Style**: Magenta border in interactive shell
- **Cognitive Role**: Innovation and creative problem-solving

**How They're Determined**:
Bridge memories use a unique algorithm that looks for:
- **Low Direct Similarity**: Memories not obviously related to your query
- **High Connection Potential**: Strong links to your activated memories
- **Novelty Score**: Calculated as `1.0 - similarity_to_query`
- **Bridge Score**: `(novelty_weight √ó novelty) + (connection_weight √ó connection_potential)`

**Examples**:
- **Query**: "machine learning algorithms"
- **Bridge Memories**:
  - Cooking recipes (both involve optimization and iteration)
  - Musical composition (pattern recognition and structure)
  - Gardening notes (growth processes and feedback loops)

## Technical Implementation

### Activation Strength Calculation

Each memory's activation strength is computed using multiple factors:

```python
activation_strength = (
    base_similarity_score +
    frequency_boost +      # Access count √ó 0.1 (max 0.5)
    importance_boost +     # Importance score √ó 0.3
    temporal_decay_factor  # Recency adjustment
)
```

### Classification Thresholds

```python
if activation_strength >= 0.7:
    ‚Üí Core Memory
elif activation_strength >= 0.5:
    ‚Üí Peripheral Memory

# Bridge memories use separate algorithm:
bridge_score = (0.6 √ó novelty) + (0.4 √ó connection_potential)
if bridge_score >= threshold:
    ‚Üí Bridge Memory
```

### Configuration

Default thresholds can be configured via environment variables:

```bash
# Core/Peripheral thresholds
ACTIVATION_THRESHOLD=0.7        # Core threshold
PERIPHERAL_THRESHOLD=0.5        # Peripheral threshold

# Bridge discovery settings
BRIDGE_DISCOVERY_K=5           # Number of bridge candidates
BRIDGE_NOVELTY_WEIGHT=0.6      # Weight for novelty score
BRIDGE_CONNECTION_WEIGHT=0.4   # Weight for connection potential
```

## Usage in Different Interfaces

### Interactive Shell

```bash
# Get all memory types
cognitive> retrieve "neural networks"
üéØ CORE MEMORIES (3)
üåê PERIPHERAL MEMORIES (5)
üåâ BRIDGE MEMORIES (2)

# Focus on bridges only
cognitive> bridges "neural networks"
üåâ BRIDGE MEMORIES (2)
```

### Command Line Interface

```bash
# All memory types (default)
memory_system load retrieve "neural networks"

# Specific types only
memory_system retrieve "neural networks" --types core peripheral
memory_system retrieve "neural networks" --types bridge
```

### Programmatic API

```python
# Retrieve all types
results = cognitive_system.retrieve_memories(
    query="neural networks",
    types=["core", "peripheral", "bridge"],
    max_results=10
)

# Access by type
core_memories = results["core"]
peripheral_memories = results["peripheral"]
bridge_memories = results["bridge"]
```

## Cognitive Psychology Background

This three-tier system is inspired by research in cognitive psychology and memory science:

### Spreading Activation Theory
- **Core memories**: Direct activation from query concepts
- **Peripheral memories**: Secondary activation through associative links
- **Bridge memories**: Cross-domain activation and creative insight

### Dual-Process Theory
- **System 1 (Fast)**: Core and peripheral memories for quick, contextual responses
- **System 2 (Slow)**: Bridge memories for deliberate, creative connections

### Serendipity in Information Systems
Bridge memories implement computational serendipity by:
- Breaking out of similarity-based "filter bubbles"
- Connecting disparate knowledge domains
- Enabling unexpected insights and innovation

## Best Practices

### For Query Formulation
- **Specific queries** tend to produce more core memories
- **Broad queries** generate more peripheral and bridge connections
- **Abstract concepts** often yield interesting bridge discoveries

### For Memory Storage
- **Rich metadata** improves classification accuracy
- **Diverse content** increases bridge discovery potential
- **Regular use** strengthens memory activation patterns

### For System Configuration
- **Lower thresholds** (0.6/0.4) for more inclusive results
- **Higher thresholds** (0.8/0.6) for more focused results
- **Adjust bridge weights** based on creativity vs relevance needs

## Troubleshooting

### No Bridge Memories Found
- Check if sufficient memories are loaded
- Verify bridge discovery is enabled
- Consider lowering bridge discovery threshold
- Ensure diverse content for cross-domain connections

### Too Many Peripheral Memories
- Increase peripheral threshold in configuration
- Use more specific queries
- Focus on core memories only with `--types core`

### Missing Expected Core Memories
- Check activation threshold configuration
- Verify memory importance scores
- Consider if memories need more frequent access to boost relevance

## Memory Decay and Lifecycle

### Dual Memory System with Decay

The system implements biologically-inspired memory decay with two distinct storage types:

#### Episodic Memory (Fast Decay)
- **Purpose**: Recent, specific experiences and interactions
- **Decay Rate**: Fast exponential decay (configurable in `cognitive_memory/storage/dual_memory.py`)
- **Retention**: Maximum 30 days absolute limit
- **Removal Criteria**:
  - Age exceeds retention period
  - Strength falls below minimum threshold
  - Importance score becomes negligible

#### Semantic Memory (Slow Decay)
- **Purpose**: Generalized patterns and consolidated knowledge
- **Decay Rate**: Very slow exponential decay (10x slower than episodic)
- **Retention**: Months to years, no automatic expiration
- **Consolidation**: Frequently accessed episodic memories get promoted to semantic

### Data Flow for Memory Lifecycle

```

                      ‚Üì                                        ‚Üì
                 Decay Calculation                    Semantic Storage
                      ‚Üì                                        ‚Üì
              Cleanup if Expired                      Long-term Retention
```

### Configuration Sources

Memory decay parameters are defined in:

- **Decay Rates**: `cognitive_memory/storage/dual_memory.py` (DualMemorySystem class)
- **Cleanup Intervals**: `cognitive_memory/core/config.py` (CognitiveConfig.cleanup_interval_hours)
- **Consolidation Criteria**: `cognitive_memory/core/cognitive_system.py` (CognitiveSystem.consolidate_memories)
- **Retention Limits**: `cognitive_memory/storage/dual_memory.py` (episodic/semantic retention policies)

### Consolidation Process

**Automatic Promotion Criteria** (episodic ‚Üí semantic):
- Access frequency threshold (defined in consolidation logic)
- Minimum strength requirement
- Age requirement for stability
- Connection strength to other memories

**Manual Cleanup** via:
```bash
# Trigger consolidation cycle
memory_system shell
cognitive> consolidate

# Clean expired memories
cognitive> cleanup
```

### Key Implementation Files

- `cognitive_memory/core/cognitive_system.py` - Main CognitiveSystem orchestrator
- `cognitive_memory/core/config.py` - CognitiveConfig with system parameters
- `memory_system/cli.py` - Service management CLI with cleanup commands
- `memory_system/interactive_shell.py` - Interactive shell for manual operations

**Note**: Cleanup is currently manual rather than automated. The system tracks when cleanup should occur but requires explicit triggering through CLI or API calls.
