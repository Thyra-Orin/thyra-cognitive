# Create a Test Plan document - Follow below instructions from top-down

Use the following instructions to create a comprehensive automated test plan document for a new Letrado feature. This document will accompany the implementation plan, but the tests should NOT be implemented yet.

## Create a TODO with EXACTLY these 4 Items

1. Analyze Feature Behavior and Test Requirements
2. Define Unit Test Cases
3. Outline Integration Test Scenarios
4. Design E2E End-to-End Tests

Follow these steps to generate a thorough automated TEST PLAN and QA document.

## DETAILS on every TODO item

### 1. Analyze Feature Behavior and Test Requirements

check: <$ARGUMENTS>

If empty, prompt user for feature description, otherwise interpret <$ARGUMENTS> as the feature to be tested.

- FIND the relevant document document in docs/ directory
- FIND and READ the corresponding Feature Description document in docs/feature_description. STOP and call the user IF NOT FOUND.
- IDENTIFY all testable feature behaviors
- DETERMINE requirements for different user types (anonymous, authenticated, premium)
- ANALYZE state transitions and data flow
- IDENTIFY dependencies that need mocking
- DETERMINE test environment requirements
- CONSIDER localization implications for Portuguese content

### 2. Define Unit Test Cases

- LIST specific unit test files to create in frontend/src/tests/unit/
- SPECIFY required test inputs and expected outputs
- IDENTIFY edge cases and boundary conditions
- OUTLINE error case testing requirements
- DETERMINE mocking requirements for Firebase services
- SUGGEST appropriate Jest assertions and test structure

### 3. Outline Integration Test Scenarios

- CREATE integration test files in frontend/src/tests/integration/
- DEFINE component interaction test cases
- SPECIFY context provider integration tests
- OUTLINE Firebase service integration tests
- DETERMINE browser storage interaction tests
- SUGGEST appropriate testing libraries and approaches

### 4. Design E2E End-to-End Tests

- DEFINE critical user flow test files in frontend/src/tests/e2e/
- OUTLINE Firebase emulator setup and cleanup code
- SPECIFY data seeding requirements for the emulator
- IDENTIFY authentication-related flow tests
- DETERMINE game progression test sequences
- PROVIDE cleanup code to reset the test environment

## Output Format

IMPORTANT: The output should be a structured document, NOT actual test code.
PLACEMENT: write the document to docs/test_plans directory.


In this specific order:

- **Test Plan: [Feature Name]** Use the same feature name as the implementation plan
- **Feature Test Overview:** Brief description of the testing approach
- **Test Scope:** Summary of what is and isn't covered in the automated tests
- **Unit Tests:** Detailed specification of unit test files with test cases, inputs and expected outputs
- **Integration Tests:** Comprehensive list of integration test files and scenarios
- **E2E Tests:** End-to-end test files with emulator setup, test sequences, and cleanup
- **Test Environment Setup:** Required configuration for running the automated tests

Focus exclusively on automated testing. Provide specific test file names and locations within the frontend/src/tests directory structure. Include setup and teardown code for tests that use the Firebase emulator, ensuring proper initialization and cleanup. Emphasize thorough coverage of feature functionality through the different test levels.
